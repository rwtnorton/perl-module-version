NAME
    perl-module-version - utility to find $VERSION of Perl module

USAGE
     $ perl-module-version IO::File
     $ perl-module-version [--help | -h | -?]

DESCRIPTION
    Simple, light-weight utility for extracting the $VERSION of a Perl
    module. Writes to "stdout".

    Shorthand for:

        perl -MSome::Module -le 'print $Some::Module::VERSION'

    with the nicety of reporting if $VERSION is undef, etc.

CAVEATS
    In order to get the value of $VERSION, the module will be loaded.
    Consequently:

    *   the module in question must be free of syntax errors

    *   the module should be free of on-load side-effects

    For most modules, this requirement should not cause problems.

TODO
    Handle modules that are stuffed in with other module files.

BUGS
    None so far.
